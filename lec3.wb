@section{Introduction}
@defn
@title{(System of Linear Equations).}
  A @keyword{system of linear equations} is a collection of $m$ equations in the variables $x_{1},\,x_{2},\,x_{3},\ldots,x_{n}$ of the form:
\begin{align*}
a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+a_{13}x_3+\dots+a_{1n}x_n&=b_1\\
a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+a_{23}x_3+\dots+a_{2n}x_n&=b_2\\
a_{31}x_1+a_{32}x_2+a_{33}x_3+\dots+a_{3n}x_n&=b_3\\
&\vdots\\
a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+a_{m3}x_3+\dots+a_{mn}x_n&=b_m
\end{align*}
where $a_{ij}$, $b_{i}$ and $x_{j}$, $1\leq i\leq m$, $1\leq j\leq n$, are real numbers.  
@end
@defn
  $(s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{n})$ is a @keyword{solution} of a system of linear equations in $n$ variables if every equation in the system is valid for $x_1 = s_1, x_2 = s_2, \ldots, x_n = s_n$.
The @keyword{solution set} of a linear system of equations is the set consisting of all solutions to the system, and nothing more.  
@end
@slide
@eg
  The following system of linear equations
\begin{align*}
x_1+2x_2+ x_4&= 7\\
x_1+x_2+x_3-x_4&=3\\
3x_1+x_2+5x_3-7x_4&=1
\end{align*}
can be rewritten as:

@newcol
  \begin{align*}
1x_1+2x_2 + 0 x_3 + 1x_4&= 7\\
1x_1+1x_2+1x_3-1x_4&=3\\
3x_1+1x_2+5x_3-7x_4&=1
\end{align*}
So it is a system of linear equations, with $n=4$ variables and $m=3$ equations. Also,
\begin{align*}
a_{11}&=1 & a_{12}&=2 & a_{13}&=0 & a_{14}&=1 & b_{1}&=7\\
a_{21}&=1 & a_{22}&=1 & a_{23}&=1 & a_{24}&=-1 & b_{2}&=3\\
a_{31}&=3 & a_{32}&=1 & a_{33}&=5 & a_{34}&=-7 & b_{3}&=1
\end{align*}One solution is given by $x_{1}=-2$, $x_{2}=4$, $x_{3}=2$, $x_{4}=1$. In fact, from the previous lecture this system of equations has infinitely many solutions.

The solution set may be descrbied as follows:

@col
  \[
\{(-1-2a+3b,\,4+a-2b,\,a,\,b)\,|\,a,b \in \mathbb{R}\}.
\]  
@endcol

@section{Possibilities for Solution Sets}
@defn
@label{def:CS}
  A system of linear equations is @keyword{consistent} if it has at least one solution. Otherwise, the system is called @keyword{inconsistent}.  
@end
@eg
@newcol
@enumerate
@item
  The following system of linear equations has @keyword{only one solution}.
\begin{align*}
2x_1+3x_2&=3\\
x_1-x_2&=4
\end{align*}
The solution set is $(x_{1},x_{2})=(3,-1)$.

Since the solution set is nonempty, the system is <strong>consistent</strong>.  
@item
@newcol
  The following system of linear equations has @keyword{infinite many solutions}.
\begin{align*}
2x_1+3x_2&=3\\
4x_1+6x_2&=6
\end{align*}
The solution set is $\{(x_{1},x_{2})=(t,\frac{3-2t}{3})\}$, where $t$ is any real number.

Since the solution set is nonempty, the system is <strong>consistent</strong>.  
@endcol
@item
@newcol
  The following system of linear equations has @keyword{no solutions}.
\begin{align*}
2x_1+3x_2&=3\\
4x_1+6x_2&=10
\end{align*}
The solution set is empty.

So, the system is <strong>inconsistent</strong>.

@thm
@newcol
  A system of linear equations can have (1) a unique solution or (2) infinitely many solutions
or (3) no solutions.  
@endcol
@end
@remark
@newcol
  For example it is impossible for a system of     linear equation to have exactly $2$ solutions.

@section{Equivalent Systems and Equation Operations}
@defn
@title{Equivalent Systems}
  Two systems of linear equations are @keyword{equivalent} if their solution sets are equal.  
@end
@defn
@title{Equation Operations}
@label{EO}
@newcol
  Given a system of linear equations, the following three operations will transform the system into a different one, and each operation is known as an @keyword{equation operation}:  
@ol
@li
  Swap the locations of two equations in the list of equations.  
@li
  Multiply each term of an equation by a nonzero number.  
@li
  Multiply each term of one equation by some number, and add these terms to a second equation, on both sides of the equality.  
@endol
@endcol
@end
@slide
@eg
@newcol
  The following two systems equations are equivalent:
\[\begin{cases}2x_{1}+3x_{2}=3\\
x_{1}-x_{2}=4\end{cases}\]
and
\[\begin{cases}5x_{2}=-5\\
x_{1}-x_{2}=4\end{cases}\]  
@col
  In fact, the second system of linear equations is obtained by applying operation 3 on equation 1 (namley, replace equation 1 with [equation 1] - 2 $\times$Â [equation 2]).  
@endcol
@end
@slide
@thm
@title{Equation Operations Preserve Solution Sets}
@label{EOPSS}
  If we apply one of the three equation operations of Definition          @ref{EO} to a system of linear equations, then the original system and the transformed system are equivalent.  
@end
@proof
@newcol
  This will be clear after we have established Theorem @ref{REMES} in a later chapter.
