it was at $t =0$). Another plane is $z=0$, which is also three-dimensional; it is the ordinary
$x-y$ plane taken over all time. Those three-dimensional planes will intersect! They share
the ordinary $x-y$ plane at $t = 0$. We are down to two dimensions, and the next plane
leaves a line. Finally a fourth plane leaves a single point. It is the intersection point of 4
planes in 4 dimensions, and it solves the 4 underlying equations.</paragraphs>

$(n-1)$-dimensional plane in $n$ dimensions, The second plane intersects it (we hope) in
a smaller set of dimension $n-2$. Assuming all goes well, every new plane (every new
equation) reduces the dimension by one. At the end, when all $n$ planes are accounted
for, the intersection has dimension zero. It is a point, it lies on all the planes, and its
coordinates satisfy all $n$ equations. It is the solution! </paragraphs>
